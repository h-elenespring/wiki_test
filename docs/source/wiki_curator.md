# Curator of the group wiki

Current curator: Helene

## What I do
* Resolve technical problems with the wiki 
* Think of ways to improve the wiki (ease of access to the information it contains, new features)
* Monitor the quality of the wiki's contents (outdated information, broken links, etc.)
* Encourage others to contribute to the wiki :)

I would like to invite everyone to open an issue if they would like to suggest an improvement to the wiki.

If you're experiencing a technical issue or other problem with the wiki, you can either open an issue or contact me directly.
